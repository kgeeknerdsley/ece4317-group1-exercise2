# Exercise 2
## ECE 4317, Group 1

This exercise involved the design of an eight-puzzle object, then using it in a variety of searches to generate some trees and the goal state.

## Code Information:
* eightpuzzle.py: Holds the class interface and method definitions for a state of the eight-puzzle
* bfs.py: Breadth first search
* bfsMap.py: Maps the breadth first search (maybe we won't need this)
* astar.py: A* search
